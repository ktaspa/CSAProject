# CSA Project

This program allows the user to add different TV shows to a database that already has popular TV shows. It keeps track of the name, platform itâ€™s viewed on, length, rating, etc. and also keeps track of your favorites. This allows for the user to easily keep track of which TV shows they have finished and which they have not across all platforms as well as which ones they enjoyed.
	A show object is needed for this database which will contain: name, platform, length, rating, year, type, current episode: For instance:

**_(I created this as part of the final project for AP Computer Sceince A) _ **

Show:  
Name  
Platform  
Length  
Rating  
Year

Current Episode  

Sample Data:  
Regular Show  
Hulu  
261 Episodes

Whenever the user has watched another episode they can increment the episodes watched. If the user wants to keep track of favorite shows they can add to a separate list.
